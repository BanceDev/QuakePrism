# LibreProgsDeluxe

This is mostly-vanilla, fully GPL Quake gamecode.

It's based on [quakec-v1-01-clean](https://gitlab.com/quakec-v1-01-clean/quakec-v1-01-clean), which integrates bugfixes over the 1.01 GPL gamecode release.

The goal of LibreProgsDeluxe is to provide a fully GPL gamecode with vanilla gameplay, minus some minor bugs present in the original gamecode. The "Deluxe" part of the name refers to relatively minor additions for mapping convenience to replace, e.g., some map hacks otherwise necessary with fully vanilla gamecode.
